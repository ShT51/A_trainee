/**
 * You have two classes:
 * Employee (name: String, salary: Long) and
 * Department (name: String, code: String, employees: List<Employee>).
 * Both classes have getters for all fields with the corresponding names (getName(), getSalary(), getEmployees() and so on).
 * <p>
 * Write a method using Stream API that calculates the general number of employees with salary >= threshold
 * for all departments whose code starts with string "111-" (without "").
 * Perhaps, flatMap method can help you to implement it.
 * <p>
 * Classes Employee and Department will be available during testing.
 * You can define your own classes for local testing.
 * <p>
 * Examples: there are 2 departments (in JSON notation) below and ï»¿threshold = 20 000.
 * The result is 1 (because there is only one suitable employee).
